Data Structure:

A data structure is a way to organize, arrange, and store data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently.

Why we study data structures:

To build fast, efficient, and well-organized programs. Even powerful computers can run slow if data isn't managed properly.


Linear Data Structure:

A linear data structure stores elements in a straight line or sequence, where each item has a next (and possibly a previous) element. Data flows in one direction.

Common Linear Data Structures:

Array

Linked List

Stack

Queue

Non-Linear Data Structure:

A non-linear data structure stores elements in a hierarchical or interconnected way, where elements can be connected to multiple other elements, not just the one before or after.

Hierarchical means some elements are “above” or “below” others — like a family tree, where a parent node can have several children.

Common Non-Linear Data Structures:

Tree

Graph

Heap

Trie
