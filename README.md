## Data Structure And Algorithm 

### Data Structure:

A data structure is a way to organize, arrange, and store data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently.

### Why we study data structures:

To build fast, efficient, and well-organized programs. Even powerful computers can run slow if data isn't managed properly.

### 1. Linear Data Structure:

A linear data structure stores elements in a straight line or sequence, where each item has a next (and possibly a previous) element. Data flows in one direction.

#### Common Linear Data Structures:

- Array
- Linked List
- Stack
- Queue

### 2. Non-Linear Data Structure:

A non-linear data structure stores elements in a hierarchical or interconnected way, where elements can be connected to multiple other elements, not just the one before or after.

Hierarchical means some elements are “above” or “below” others like a family tree, where a parent node can have several children.

#### Common Non-Linear Data Structures:

- Tree
- Graph
- Heap
- Trie
